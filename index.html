                During its return to the earth, commercial spaceship Nostromo intercepts a distress signal from a
                distant planet. When a three-member team of the crew discovers a chamber containing thousands of eggs on
                the planet, a creature inside one of the eggs attacks an explorer. The entire crew is unaware of the
                impending nightmare set to descend upon them when the alien parasite planted inside its unfortunate host
                is birthed.

                The seemingly invincible Spider-Man goes up against an all-new crop of villains—including the
                shape-shifting Sandman. While Spider-Man’s superpowers are altered by an alien organism, his alter ego,
                Peter Parker, deals with nemesis Eddie Brock and also gets caught up in a love triangle.

                A wave of gruesome murders is sweeping Tokyo. The only connection is a bloody X carved into the neck of
                each of the victims. In each case, the murderer is found near the victim and remembers nothing of the
                crime. Detective Takabe and psychologist Sakuma are called in to figure out the connection, but their
                investigation goes nowhere…
